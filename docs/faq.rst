Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

An implicit requirement here is that you are somewhat familiar with AWS and
HTTP in general. The bulk of the instructions in this project will reference
the `aws cli`__ but you are welcome to use the `AWS console`__ if you are more
familiar with that.

Is there a hosted version of IRC Hooky I could use instead?
-----------------------------------------------------------

There very well might be! But unfortunately this isn't it. The complexity of
adding user & account management on top of IRC Hooky isn't in the scope of this
project.

Where do I report bugs?
-----------------------

It would be awesome if you could open up a `Github Issue`__ with as much detail
as you can provide. Then we can talk it through and see what needs doing!

How do I contribute to IRC Hooky?
---------------------------------

`Pull Requests`__ work best here. If you need my help with a new feature get a
hold of me (`Marvin Pinto`__) and I'll help you out!
