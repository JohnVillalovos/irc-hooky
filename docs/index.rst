Welcome to IRC Hooky!
=====================

IRC Hooky makes it easy to send custom webhook-triggered notifications to IRC
using an entirely serverless architecture.

Using a combination of `AWS Lambda`__ and `API Gateway`__, listening for and
delivering webhooks could cost pennies per month compared to an actual server
and all the maintenance that comes with it.

The Lambda and API Gateway **pay-only-for-what-you-use** model seems to fit
perfectly for this use case!
